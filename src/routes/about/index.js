			<h2>Security</h2>
			<p>
        MNGED uses <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> for authentication and as a database. Firesbase is developed and maintained
				by Google. The authentication is build by the same team that also build Google Sign In and is responsible for other security at Google.
				But that also means that Google has access to our database which you may or may not care about.

			<p>
        These sort of Web applications are called Progressive Web Apps (PWA).
        PWA's stand out because they are fast and always work,
        even with no connection to the internet.

        As the UI provider I decided to go with <a href="https://preactjs.com">Preact</a>, a lightweight 3kb fork of React.
        For storing the state I use <a href="https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html">MobX</a>, it's a simple but powerful state management solution.
        And finally as the database I went with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a>, a mostly free hosting and database provided by Google.
        The nice thing about firebase is that it comes with a nice JavaScript library which enables Authentication and live-updates when the database changes.
